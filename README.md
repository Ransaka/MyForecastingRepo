# MyForecastingRepoðŸ“ˆ

Forecasting plays a huge role in some industires such as retailer, telecommiunication and more. We all can agree that, forecasting future is not an easy task.Due to that reason
unlike other machine learning approches, forecasting requres spaecial kind of methods. For me, forecasting is very insteresting whole new are of machine learning. The purpose of
this repo is experiment deferent kinds of algorithms, modeling methods, preprocessing steps and lastly, improving the quality of forecasting result.

| Forecasting - Getting started | [Getting started](https://github.com/Ransaka/MyForecastingRepo/tree/master/01.%20Getting%20started) | If you are new to forecasting (time series analysis) you may start with this stage. here I'll discuss about xgboost, ARIMA and prophet modles. | [xgboost](https://github.com/Ransaka/MyForecastingRepo/blob/master/01.%20Getting%20started/01.%20xgboost%20model.ipynb),[prophet](https://github.com/Ransaka/MyForecastingRepo/blob/master/01.%20Getting%20started/03.%20Prophet%20model.ipynb),[ARIMA](https://github.com/Ransaka/MyForecastingRepo/blob/master/01.%20Getting%20started/02.%20ARIMA%20model.ipynb) |
| Forecasting - Intermediate |[Intermediate](https://github.com/Ransaka/MyForecastingRepo/blob/master/02.%20Intermediate/ARIMA%20and%20Family.ipynb) | In this section I have explained some concepts of (S)ARIMA(X) modeling. | ARIMA |
| Forecasting- Advanced | Todo | Some advanced concepts/algorithms involved in forecasting such as Temporal Fusion Transformers and DeepAR |DeepAR,TFT and more.|
